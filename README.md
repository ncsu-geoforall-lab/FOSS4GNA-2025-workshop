# GRASS Addon Development with Python

## FOSS4GNA-2025-workshop

Workshop Participant Level: Advanced

![GRASS Logo](https://grass.osgeo.org/images/logos/grass-gradient-horizontal.svg)

Learn to develop [GRASS addons](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons) with
Python! Together, we will develop a parallelized custom addon with Python,
command line, and graphical user interfaces. [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
works as a powerful geospatial processing engine that works on a small laptop to
a huge supercomputer. GRASS also makes it easy to move from using a
[graphical user interface (GUI)](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass85/manuals/helptext.html)
to command line interface or
[Python API](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass85/manuals/python_intro.html).
During this workshop we will develop a GRASS addon exploring the various
[GRASS Python modules](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/libpython/index.html),
tooling, and best practice required to produce high quality open source software.
The bonus material for this workshop will also cover tools written in C.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, basic Python and GIS experience is
recommended. The workshop will use an online environment, so no software
installation on laptops is required from participants.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Explain GRASS fundamentals including:
   - available engine interfaces
   - how to manage geospatial data with projects,
   - and how to leverage computational region for effient processing
2. Use GRASS Python modules to develop geospatial processing tools
3. Describe the structure of a GRASS addon and community best practices for development
4. Develop command line and graphical user interfaces for GRASS addons
5. Be ready to contribute GRASS addons to the community repository :green_heart:
